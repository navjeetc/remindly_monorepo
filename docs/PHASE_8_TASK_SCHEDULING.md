# Phase 8: Shared Task & Appointment Scheduling

> **Historical — the `/api` namespace described below no longer exists.**
> It was removed in #120: all three `Api::` controllers opened with a
> `before_action` naming a method that was never defined, so every endpoint
> raised before running and none was ever called by a client, a test, or
> production. The task and availability features live in the Rails UI —
> `TasksController`, `TimeBlocksController` and `CaregiverAvailabilitiesController`
> under `app/controllers/` — and the request shapes here do not describe anything
> that still answers. Kept as a record of what was built, not as a guide.

## Overview
Enable caregivers to create, assign, and track shared tasks and appointments for seniors (doctor visits, grocery errands, etc.), allowing multiple caregivers to coordinate care responsibilities.

---

## Goals
1. **Task Management** - Create tasks beyond medication reminders (appointments, errands, activities)
2. **Caregiver Coordination** - Assign tasks to specific caregivers or leave unassigned
3. **Availability Tracking** - See who's available and divide the workload
4. **Status Updates** - Mark tasks as done, in-progress, or cancelled
5. **Notifications** - Alert assigned caregivers about upcoming tasks

---

## Database Schema

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Task completion rate | ≥ 90% | Completed / Total tasks |
| Average assignment time | ≤ 2 hours | Time from creation to assignment |
| Caregiver engagement | ≥ 80% | Caregivers using tasks weekly |
| Load distribution | ≤ 30% variance | Standard deviation of tasks per caregiver |
| On-time completion | ≥ 85% | Completed within scheduled time |

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 8.5: Advanced Features
- **Recurring tasks** - Weekly grocery shopping, monthly checkups
- **Templates** - Pre-defined task templates
- **File attachments** - Upload receipts, photos, documents
- **Task dependencies** - "Complete A before starting B"
- **Reminders via SMS** - Text message notifications
- **Integration with calendar apps** - Google Calendar, Apple Calendar
- **Expense tracking** - Track costs for errands
- **Mileage tracking** - For transportation tasks
- **Task analytics** - Reports on completion rates, time spent
- **Mobile app** - Native iOS/Android apps

### Integration Opportunities
- **Google Maps** - Directions to task locations
- **Pharmacy APIs** - Prescription refill reminders
- **Healthcare portals** - Sync with doctor appointments
- **Grocery delivery** - Integration with Instacart, etc.

---

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Index on `senior_id`, `assigned_to_id`, `scheduled_at`, `status`
- Pagination for task lists (50 per page)
- Eager loading for associations
- Cache team availability

### Security
- Verify caregiver has access to senior before showing tasks
- Audit log for task changes
- Permission checks for assignment/completion
- Rate limiting on task creation

### Data Integrity
- Validate scheduled_at is in the future (for new tasks)
- Prevent assignment to non-linked caregivers
- Cascade delete tasks when senior is deleted
- Soft delete for audit trail (optional)

---

## Migration Path

### For Existing Users
1. Introduce tasks gradually (beta feature flag)
2. Provide tutorial/walkthrough
3. Offer task templates for common scenarios
4. Import existing appointments from reminders (optional)

### Backwards Compatibility
- Reminders continue to work as-is
- Tasks are separate feature
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

---

## Documentation Needed

- [ ] User guide for caregivers
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Setup instructions
- [ ] Best practices guide
- [ ] FAQ

---

## Estimated Timeline

**Total: 17 days (3.5 weeks)**

- Sprint 1: Core Task Management (5 days)
- Sprint 2: UI & Dashboard (5 days)
- Sprint 3: Coordination Features (4 days)
- Sprint 4: Notifications (3 days)

---

## Dependencies

- Phase 7 (Caregiver Dashboard) must be complete ✅
- Email service (MagicMailer) already exists ✅
- Background jobs (Sidekiq or similar) needed for notifications
- Calendar library (FullCalendar.js or similar)

---

**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Priority:** High  
**Complexity:** Medium-High  
**Value:** High - Addresses major caregiver coordination pain point

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve Phase 8 plan
2. Create feature branch: `phase-8-task-scheduling`
3. Begin Sprint 1: Core Task Management
