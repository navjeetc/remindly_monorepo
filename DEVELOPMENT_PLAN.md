# üöÄ Remindly Development Plan

## Current Status Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Already Implemented
- **Backend (Rails 8)**
  - JWT authentication with magic link endpoints
  - User, Reminder, Occurrence, Acknowledgement models
  - `/reminders/today` endpoint returning occurrences
  - `/acknowledgements` POST endpoint
  - Recurrence engine with IceCube
  - Basic CRUD for reminders

- **macOS Client (SwiftUI)**
  - Basic UI showing today's reminders
  - Authentication flow (dev mode)
  - Acknowledge actions (Taken/Snooze/Skip)
  - Voice synthesis for reading reminders
  - Network entitlements configured
  - Large text, senior-friendly UI

### ‚ùå What's Missing (Per PRD)

#### High Priority (MVP Core)
1. **Notifications System** - Desktop notifications not implemented
2. **Reminder Creation UI** - No way to create/edit reminders from macOS app
3. **Offline Persistence** - No local storage, fully dependent on network
4. **Notification Scheduling** - No background timer or notification triggers
5. **Status Updates** - Occurrences don't update to "missed" automatically

#### Medium Priority (MVP Polish)
6. **Settings/Preferences** - No accessibility settings (font size, voice controls)
7. **Time Zone Handling** - Using server time, not user's local timezone
8. **Error Handling** - Basic error messages, needs retry logic
9. **Proper Authentication** - Still using dev mode, needs magic link flow

#### Lower Priority (Phase 1.5+)
10. **Caregiver Dashboard** - Web interface not started
11. **Caregiver Linking** - No pairing mechanism
12. **7-Day History View** - Only shows today
13. **Multi-language Support** - English only
